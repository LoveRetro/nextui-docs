## Getting Started

!!! warning "Read before continuing!"

    NextUI **officially supports** the TrimUI Brick, Smart Pro and Smart Pro S.

    The steps outlined here only apply to these two devices running the stock operating system.

    If you are planning to install NextUI after using a different custom firmware on your device, 
    we recommend to first reinstall the TrimUI stock OS to revert any changes that might have been
    made without your knowledge. The only exception is MinUI.



### What You Will Need

- A TrimUI Brick or TrimUI Smart Pro running the stock operating system.
- A fresh micro SD card from a reputable vendor (SanDisk, Samsung, etc.)
    - The size of the card depends on the size of the ROMs you plan to play
- Software on your computer to format the SD Card
    - On macOS, use built-in Disk Utility application
    - On Windows, use [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/en/)
- The latest release of NextUI from the [GitHub Repo :simple-github:]({{ urls.github }}/releases).
    - At minimum, you will need the `base.zip` file.
    - If you want additional goodies, download `extras.zip` as well (or download `all.zip` to get both files in one).

#### [Optional]

- The community made [NextUI Setup Wizard](https://github.com/aaronhoogstraten/NextUI-Setup-Wizard) for Windows and macOS provides an easy to use interface for performing the setup of your NextUI device, including:
    - Micro SD card formatting instructions
    - Latest NextUI release download and installation to micro SD card
    - ROM and BIOS setup instructions for popular systems
