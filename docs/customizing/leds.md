Currently, this is only supported by:

- Power Button turning red alerting for low battery

Setting brightness to `0` will turn the LED off.

#### Ambient Mode

!!! info "Only supported By certain emulator cores"

    Ambient light effects are only supported by the built in Libretro cores.

Ambient light mode makes your LEDs change color to match the dominant color on screen during gameplay.

To enable ambient mode (in a supported emulator) follow these steps:

1. While in game, press the `Menu` button
2. Select `Options`
3. Select `Frontend`
4. Scroll down to the Ambient Mode line and turn it on. You can select to use all LEDs or just a specific one.

!!! info "Ambient mode sets the LED Brightness to Maximum"

    We found that lower brightness levels will result in displaying an incorrect color.
