Since MinUI and NextUI share a lot of DNA, you can just install NextUI over an existing MinUI installation.

There is no need to format your exising card, just follow the [installation guide](../usage.md#installation-instructions)
from step 3, using the `all.zip` archive from the latest NextUI release.
